# Game of Realms

The first high-stakes contest will see participants compete for the tiered membership to co-own the Gno.land blockchain.
A series of complex technical and non-technical tasks will challenge contributors to create innovative patterns that push the chain to new limits.
Start building the foundation for tomorrow through key smart contracts and other contributions that change our understanding of the world.

You can start participating in the co-creation of the Game of Realms now by adding your contributions on the dedicated [GitHub page](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/357) to help us formulate the challenges. We want to release the final challenges from your contributions.
